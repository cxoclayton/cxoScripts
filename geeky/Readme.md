# Geeky 

I use [GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/) as a means to put many things on my desktop. I'm a big fan of plain text files, bash scripts, and other things. You can find general files in this directory with subsequent directories dedicated to  specific functions or applications. Most of these scripts are for a Mac OS machine, so please use them at your own risk. 

# iCalBuddy
I use [iCalBuddy](http://hasseg.org/icalBuddy/) so much in my GeekTool scripts that I believe it really deserved its own section. iCalBuddy is great for making plain text of your calendars. For the most part it's a planning tool, but it can be great for knowing what's on my today list.
